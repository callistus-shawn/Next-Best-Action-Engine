Ladies toilet was closed off, disabled toilet was locked. -
[Customer]: @Tesco The staff where alerted to this after about six of us waited outside the disabled loo thinking someone was in there.

Alas, nobody was to-
[Customer]: @Tesco be seen or heard.

I alerted some staff because hey, ladies need to pee, there was an older woman there and also, my immunodeficient mother-
[Customer]: @Tesco was in appallingly desperate need.

Was someone dead or unconscious in that toilet? There was a legit concern. For there was not a sound-
[Customer]: @Tesco from within and surely, surely with a scrap of sense wouldn’t think to foolishly LOCK this disabled access bathroom with the ladies being-
[Customer]: @Tesco out of action.

Seriously, a fucker could have been dead and it took staff a further ten minutes of screwing around to unlock the disabled-
[Customer]: @Tesco loo by which point, I had not only used a cubicle in the mens room, I had also washed my hands and witnessed an unfortunate male member of-
[Customer]: @Tesco the public stop mid-stream in appropriate Halloween terror as he realised their was a LADY NO LESS a mere 1.5 meters behind him.

On -
[Customer]: @Tesco reporting back to my ladies, my comrades in urination frustration, one of them had scuttled, assuming the waddle to the main mall would be-
[Customer]: @Tesco kinder to her wait time. Two, the nice elder lady, was very calmly calling out the lackadaisical approach by the staff and three, my dear -
[Customer]: @Tesco mother had moved the barrier aside to the ladies to use the facilities there.

The rest either died of renal failure of had also scuttled-
[Customer]: @Tesco by then.

The unfortunate man regained his stream.

I washed my hands five times because I had to put the mens toilet seat down.

And -
[Customer]: @Tesco finally, the old lady got access to the aforementioned disabled loo.

Oh and PS, three teenage girls used your babychange facilities for -
[Customer]: @Tesco reasons other than changing a baby. I believe they are toilet trained and had no reason to be there. Your staff witnessed this and did-
[Customer]: @Tesco nothing.

Sort it fucking out tesco.

[Company]: @116151 @115913 Please meet me back in DM. We'll work on this together. *ZachRicketts
[Customer]: @TMobileHelp @115913 I don’t mean to be rude to you or anything. It’s very Frustrating! I feel like you guys don’t want me back!

The customer's most frequent sentiment is positive, so a friendly and helpful tone is appropriate. The conversation length is 7 messages, but the current question seems simple and doesn't warrant a phone call or email at this stage.",pending_customer_reply
116952,"[Customer]: Nothing like waiting at the airport for 3.5 hours because @AlaskaAir employees can’t do their jobs right and argue with their customers (who are right).
[Company]: @116952 Hi Harley, I'm sorry to hear about your delay. Can you message me your confirmation code? -Tara
[Customer]: @AlaskaAir Wasn’t a delay. I told the guy at the counter my bag wasn’t tagged and he said “yes it is” and pointed at my old tag from @SouthwestAir and proceeded to process my bag. I now have to wait 3.5 hours for my bag to get to SFO from PDX.
[Company]: @116952 aaahhh, I see now. I'm sorry to hear about the baggage issue. I'm guessing they found it and tagged it for a later flight? -Tara
[Customer]: @AlaskaAir That’s literally what I just said. Doesn’t excuse the fact that your employee argued with me and as a result I’m paying ($25/bag) to wait an extra 3.5 hours. Never flying your service again.
[Company - RECOMMENDED]: @116952 Harley, I am so sorry that our employee's mistake led to this baggage issue and the extra cost. That's definitely not the experience we want you to have. I've documented this incident and will be forwarding it to our baggage handling team for review and retraining. To help compensate for the inconvenience, I'd like to offer you a refund for the baggage fee. Could you DM me your booking reference so I can process this for you? We value your business and hope you'll reconsider flying with us in the future.",twitter_dm_reply,"@116952 Harley, I am so sorry that our employee's mistake led to this baggage issue and the extra cost.

A quick, empathetic response offering a tangible solution (baggage fee refund) is the best approach to try and salvage the situation. Given the conversation length is short and the issue is relatively straightforward (incorrect baggage handling), a Twitter DM is appropriate. The customer's negative sentiment and the order/delivery problem history suggest a proactive approach is needed to attempt to resolve the issue quickly and efficiently. Offering a refund and escalating the incident internally addresses both the immediate problem and the underlying cause.",pending_customer_reply
